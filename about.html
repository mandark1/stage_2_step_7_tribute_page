                with
                information about some of my favourite things! I thought I'd start with this page to give some general
                information. Sweden is a country in Scandinavia with a population of 10.35 million. It borders Norway
                and Finland and is also connected to Denmark via a bridge-tunnel in the South-West.<br /><br />

                The capital city of Sweden is Stockholm, which is built across 14 islands. The Swedish capital has
                arguably the world’s
                coolest public transport systems. Walking into a Stockholm metro station is said to be entering the
                “world’s longest art exhibition”, which is over 68 miles (110km) long. Around 90% of the stations have
                been decorated by over 150 artists in different themes and in various forms, including mosaics,
                paintings, graffiti, installations, sculptures, and so on.<br /><br />

                Sweden is a very progressive country, an entire nation driven by a desire to change the world for the
                better, setting an example to the rest of
                the world through sustainability, social welfare, peace, successful accomplishments in reducing waste,
                and its sheer creativity and a culture immersed in sustainability. Over two thirds of Sweden's land area
                is forest, and they have over 90,000 lakes.</p>
