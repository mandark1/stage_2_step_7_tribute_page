        <p class="general-text text-box">ABBA are a Swedish pop group that were formed in 1972. The name ABBA is an
            acronym (and also a palindrome) of
            the initials of their first names, Agnetha, Björn, Benny and Anni-Frid. ABBA won the Eurovision Song contest
            in 1974 and became Sweden's first ever winners with the song "Waterloo", becoming overnight sensations. Over
            the course of their career they have released 9 studio albums together, 8 before they split in 1982 and the
            most recent one in 2021 after reconciling to record a new album.<br /><br />

            With hundreds of millions of records sold
            worldwide, they are one of the most biggest-selling music acts of all-time. The musical, Mamma Mia!, based
            on their hit catalog, opened in London in 1999 and in New York on 2001. Both productions are among the most
            successful musicals ever on the West End and Broadway. A movie version also called Mamma Mia! was released
            in 2008. In the United Kingdom, Mamma Mia! grossed £69.2 million, it is also the fifteenth highest-grossing
            film of all time at the UK box office.</p>
