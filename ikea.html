        <p class="general-text text-box">IKEA was founded by Ingvar Kamprad in 1943 and came to life as a mail order
            catalogue business in the
            forested town of Älmhult, Sweden. Today, it is a global home furnishing brand that brings affordability,
            design and comfort to people all over the world. The IKEA vision is “To create a better everyday life for
            the many people.”, not just with their furniture but also with sustainability and the environment. Their
            business idea is “to offer a wide range of well-designed, functional home furnishing products at prices so
            low that as many people as possible will be able to afford them.”<br /><br />

            The furniture is simplistic and
            minimalistic, much like most Scandinavian style interiors. I personally love that you can get such
            functional items at such low prices and they actually look nice in your home too. Also, who doesn't love a
            hot dog (or varmkorv in Swedish) as they're leaving IKEA, it's an absolute must!!
